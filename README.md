# FINAL PROJECT

# PROTECT THE BASE
My final project will be called Protect The Base. The objective of the game is to fend off as many enemy ramming ships as possible.  Although there is only one player, the player is two turrets as reinforcement.  The ship and base both start at 100 health points (HP).  If the player is rammed, it loses 10 HP.  If the base is rammed, it loses 5 HP.  If the turrets are rammed, the base loses 10 HP as the turrents are part of the base itself. I officially started around week seven and have been working inconsistently on it.  I have spent more time researching and learning Qt rather than actively writing. I have been working offline and hence there will be diffculty of checking its timeline.

This project should be complete in terms of functionality.  But as artistic person, it lacks any graphics, which displeases me.  I will add the graphics as soon as I can.  The project is messy due to it being one of my very few experiences with Qt Creator.  However, I have leanred a lot and am confident I can work on Qt at a faster pace.
